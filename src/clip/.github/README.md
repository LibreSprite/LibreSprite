*Last updated: 2025-12-30*

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files for the [clip](https://github.com/dacap/clip) clipboard library.

## Contents

- **workflows/** - GitHub Actions CI workflow definitions (see [workflows/README.md](workflows/README.md)).

## Purpose

These files configure GitHub features for the upstream clip library repository. They are included here as part of the forked/vendored third-party code but are not used by the LibreSprite build process.
