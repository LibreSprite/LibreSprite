## History
LibreSprite originated as a fork of [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org), developed by [David Capello](https://github.com/dacap). Aseprite used to be distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2, but was moved to a proprietary license on [August 26th, 2016](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/5ecc356a41c8e29977f8608d8826489d24f5fa6c).

This fork was made on the [last commit](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/03be4aa23db465219962f4c62410f628e7392545) covered by the GPL version 2 license, and is now developed independently of Aseprite.
