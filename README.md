## History
LibreSprite originated as a fork of [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org), developed by [David Capello](https://github.com/dacap). Aseprite used to be distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2, but was moved to a proprietary license on [August 26th, 2016](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/5ecc356a41c8e29977f8608d8826489d24f5fa6c).

This fork was made on the [last commit](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/commit/03be4aa23db465219962f4c62410f628e7392545) covered by the GPL version 2 license, and is now developed independently of Aseprite.

## Contributing
As LibreSprite has a newly budding community, we need help building the infrastructure of our development, support, and news networks. If you would like to help, please make yourself known at [#LibreSprite](https://webchat.freenode.net/#LibreSprite) and checkout our our guide on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Compiling
Currently we don’t have binaries available, this means you will have to roll up your sleeves and compile LibreSprite if you want to try it out. Don't worry, it isn't as hard as you might think! Remember, we’re there to help you out at [#LibreSprite](https://webchat.freenode.net/#LibreSprite) if you get stuck.

The instructions are detailed [here](INSTALL.md).
